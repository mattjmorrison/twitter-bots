Steve Castle is a sleazy wall street figure from the 80s. If you mention him on
twitter `@SteveCastleCEO` he will respond with the hippest 80s executive
non-speak. He is also a life coach and powerful leadership figure. He will
help calm your concerns if you tell him what you are "worried about" for
example `@SteveCastleCEO I am worried about the ethics of this company`

As the name implies the Paper Rock Bot plays games of paper rock scissors  with
any interested twitter users. In order to play all you need to do is tweet
`@PaperRockBot` and include the words `paper`, `rock` or `scissors`. For
example `@PaperRockBot I choose paper`
